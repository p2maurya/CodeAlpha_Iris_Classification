# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification | CodeAlpha Internship Project

This project is part of my **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**, where I built a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species — *Setosa, Versicolor,* and *Virginica* — using Python.

## 📘 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.  
The goal of this project is to predict the type of Iris flower based on the features:
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

I used **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Random Forest Classifier** to train and compare models.
